Make 10 Train Game
Make 10 from arbitrary set of numbers using operators

On the Sydney trains, each carriage has a unique 4 digit number, usually preceded by some letter, printed up on the interior wall. It has been a reoccurring game amongst my friends over the past few years that whenever we are on a train we need to try to make 10 using the carriage number. Furthermore, I believe this game is known amongst many Sydneysiders and hence I decided to write about it. The rules are simple though there are a few variations: Using common mathematical operations make 10 using the individual digits from left to right.

For example, the carriage number might be 5432, ignoring the prepended letter. An appropriate solution might be 5 + 4 + 3â€“2 = 10.
